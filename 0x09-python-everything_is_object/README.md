Objects combine data values with behavior. Objects represent information, but also behave like the things that they represent. The logic of how an object interacts with other objects is bundled along with the information that encodes the object's value. When an object is printed, it knows how to spell itself out in text. If an object is composed of parts, it knows how to reveal those parts on demand. Objects are both information and processes, bundled together to represent the properties, interactions, and behaviors of complex things.

Object behavior is implemented in Python through specialized object syntax and associated terminology, which we can introduce by example. A date is a kind of object.
